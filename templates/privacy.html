            <p>
                This privacy policy provides how we (GPSClean Web) use and protects any information that you give or share when you use this website.

            <h3>Which data we collect</h3>

            <p>
                The only data that is collected, and in a <b>temporary</b> way, is the GPS trace (in the .gpx format) that you explicitly upload on the website
                to test the correcting model.
            </p>

            <h3>For how long do we keep your data?</h3>

            <p>
                The GPS trace is kept in the system just for the time needed to process it and is deleted immediately after.
                Thus, after a few seconds, the trace is permanently deleted from the system and no persistent storage is used or involved in the process.             
            </p>

            <h3>Which cookies do we use?</h3>

            <p>
                Well, none at all. No cookie or analytical tracker is used in this website.
            </p>
            
            <h3>I have a question, who should I contact?</h3>
